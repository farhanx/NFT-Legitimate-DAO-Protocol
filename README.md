#### **Project Detail**

**Problem in the Decentralized World :** In the realm of digital environments, assessing the authenticity and acceptability of an asset within a thriving and expansive community proves to be a challenging task, even with comprehensive information at hand. In fact, accomplishing this task becomes nearly unattainable in the absence of such information.

**Solution is DAO Decentralized Autonomous Organization Protocol:**
 
1) Implementation of a protocol that engages an open community can address the challenges of evaluating asset quality in a digital environment.
2) The protocol establishes a trustworthy and reliable mechanism for determining the acceptability of public assets.
3) The evaluation process is driven by a community with distributed voting power.
4) An adaptive identity validation process ensures effective oversight and moderation.
5) This approach offers a scalable solution to content moderation as the digital asset landscape expands and evolves.
6) The involvement of a self-regulated community plays a crucial role in resolving the problem.
7) The community actively decides on membership, including adding or removing individuals.
8) Consensus is reached within the community through voting to evaluate asset authenticity.
9) Each community member has the opportunity to vote on the legitimacy of an asset.

#### ** “Asset Legit” Protocol Details! **

We named our protocol “Asset Legit protocol”. In order to achieve this protocol following needs to be addressed. 

**1. DAO Creation**
A DAO must be created by the community renowned members like Ethereum Foundation, OpenSea, and others. 
Each Chain must represent its own DAO Creation with respect to a Smart Contract. For instance, Ethereum based contract will cover only Ethereum based assets. (Currently we chose Ethereum)

**2. Asset Legit Protocol ALPT Token**
The ALPT token will be created to incentivize the members.
A separate smart contract must be created with lazy minting.
These tokens should be allowed to trade as an asset.
